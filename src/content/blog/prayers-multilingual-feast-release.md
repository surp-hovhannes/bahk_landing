## 🕊️ Introducing the New Pray Tab

Prayer is at the heart of Fast & Pray, and our new Pray tab makes it easier to stay prayerful throughout your day.

- **More prayers, anytime:** Access an expanded collection of prayers to pray in the morning, throughout the day, or in moments of need.
- **Share prayer requests:** You can now add your own prayer requests and share them with the Fast & Pray community.
- **Pray together:** Join others in prayer by lifting up shared requests, strengthening our faith through community.

## 🎉 Celebrate Daily Feasts & Commemorations

On days that are not fasting days, Fast & Pray now highlights daily feasts so you can celebrate and reflect on the life of Christ and the lives of the saints.
